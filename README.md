# Code-Quiz
## Description
This web based JavaScript quiz stands as a representation of not only the power of JavaScript, but also the application of local storage manipulation, and the versatility of DOM (Document Object Model). While both of these tools are equally as important as each other, their practically in use is drastically different. JavaScript is a coding language used to allow developers the tools to change a site from static to dynamic. Using functions, variables, and loops, the developer is able to make the site interactive for user. Local storage gives the developer the ability to store items such as variables or arrays in the memory of the user's local device, in order to access it later. Lastly, DOM allows web developers to manipulate HTML elements via Javascript automation. 

This Code-Quiz uses all of these tools to display these purposed. With JavaScript and DOM, this site is able to change the content of buttons and questions as the user interacts with the quiz. Using JavaScript, this quiz then becomes timed, and a score is tallied. It also is able to check for correct and incorrect answers. Using local storage, the quiz is able to save the user's initials and scores, and bring them back into use when they visit the high scores page. 

One of the most important skills a web developer can have is versatitlity. The ability to utilize multiple languages and tools in order to accomplish one goal, while not easy, makes for a better user exerpience. Thanks to the use of JavaScript, DOM, and local storage, in conjunction with HTML and CSS, this Code Quiz becomes a aesthetically pleasing dynamic webpage.
